Consider the following nested object:

```js
let munsters = {
  Herman: { age: 32, gender: "male" },
  Lily: { age: 30, gender: "female" },
  Grandpa: { age: 402, gender: "male" },
  Eddie: { age: 10, gender: "male" },
  Marilyn: { age: 23, gender: "female" },
};
```

# PEDAC

## Understanding the Problem

- Input:
  Nested Object

- Output:
  Integer

- Rules / Requirements:
  Only add the age if the munster is a male
  Given the nested object,
  Return the sum of all the age properties for each nested object
  Assuming each age property is an integer above or equal to 0

- Mental Model:
  Break up the object into key value pairs and loop over the keys accessing each object and sum the age with a method such as reduce.

## Examples / Test Cases

```js
// Sum of all ages from given object
497;
```

## Data Structures

- Object
  Input
- Object.keys
- Reduce
- Integer
  Output

## Algorithm

Use Object.keys to get an array of each key inside the object
Then, using reduce, loop over each inner object using the key like (munsters[key].age) and add up the age integer. Return said integer when operation is completed.

## Code

```js
let munsters = {
  Herman: { age: 32, gender: "male" },
  Lily: { age: 30, gender: "female" },
  Grandpa: { age: 402, gender: "male" },
  Eddie: { age: 10, gender: "male" },
  Marilyn: { age: 23, gender: "female" },
};
Object.keys(munsters).reduce((acc, cur) => {
  if (munsters[cur].gender === "male") {
    return acc + munsters[cur].age;
  } else return acc + 0;
}, 0);
```

This could have also been done with `Object.values` and it probably would have worked better.
