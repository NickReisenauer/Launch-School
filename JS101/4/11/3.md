# Practice Problem 3

The following code differs slightly from the above code. What is the return value of map in this case? Why?

```js
[1, 2, 3].map((num) => num * num);
```

---

```js
// Returns
[1, 4, 9];
```

This is because we are using implicit return within our arrow statement to return num \* num for each element.

Without braces surrounding the body of the arrow function, JavaScript uses the computed value as the return value. In this case, the callback returns `1`, `4`, and `9` on the 3 iterations.
