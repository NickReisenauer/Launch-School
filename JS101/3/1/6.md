# Practice Problems: Easy 1

## Question 6

We have most of the Munster family in our `ages` object:

```js
let ages = { Herman: 32, Lily: 30, Grandpa: 5843, Eddie: 10 };
```

Add entries for Marilyn and Spot to the object:

```js
let additionalAges = { Marilyn: 22, Spot: 237 };
```

---

```js
Object.assign(ages, additionalAges);
```
