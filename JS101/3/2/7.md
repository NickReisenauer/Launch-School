# Practice Problems: Easy 2

## Question 7

Consider the following object:

```js
let flintstones = {
  Fred: 0,
  Wilma: 1,
  Barney: 2,
  Betty: 3,
  Bambam: 4,
  Pebbles: 5,
};
```

Create an array from this object that contains only two elements: Barney's name and Barney's number:

```js
["Barney", 2];
```

---

```js
let barney = Object.entries(flintstones)
  .filter((el) => el[1] === 2)
  .shift();
```
