## Question 3

Alan wrote the following function, which was intended to return all of the factors of number:

```js
function factors(number) {
  let divisor = number;
  let factors = [];
  do {
    if (number % divisor === 0) {
      factors.push(number / divisor);
    }
    divisor -= 1;
  } while (divisor !== 0);
  return factors;
}
factors(10);
```

Alyssa noticed that this code would fail when the input is `0` or a negative number, and asked Alan to change the loop. How can he make this work without using a `do/while loop`? Note that we're not looking to find the factors for `0` or negative numbers, but we want to handle it gracefully instead of raising an exception or going into an infinite loop.

Bonus: What is the purpose of `number % divisor === 0` in that code?

```js
// My Solution
function factors(number) {
  let divisor = number;
  let factors = [];
  if (number <= 0) return `Please input a positive number`;
  for (let i = number; i > 0; i -= 1) {
    if (number % divisor === 0) factors.push(number / divisor);
    divisor -= 1;
  }
  return factors;
}
factors(10);
```

```js
// LS Solution
function factors(number) {
  let divisor = number;
  let factors = [];
  while (divisor > 0) {
    if (number % divisor === 0) {
      factors.push(number / divisor);
    }
    divisor -= 1;
  }
  return factors;
}
factors(10);
```

Bonus Answer:

It determines whether the result of the division is an integer -- if the number has no remainder, the result is an integer, so the number divided by the divisor is a factor.
