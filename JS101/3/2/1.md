# Practice Problems: Easy 2

## Question 1

Given a string, return a new string that replaces every occurrence of the word "important" with "urgent":

```js
let advice =
  "Few things in life are as important as house training your pet dinosaur.";
```

---

```js
advice.replace("important", "urgent");
```

Note that if the string contains two or more occurrences of `important`, this code only replaces the first.

This code will handle more than one occurrence of `important`.

```js
let arr = advice.split(" ");
arr.forEach((word, index) => {
  if (word.includes("important")) {
    arr[index] = "urgent";
  }
});
advice = arr.join(" ");
```
