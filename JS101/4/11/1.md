# Practice Problem 1

What is the return value of the `filter` method call below? Why?

```js
[1, 2, 3].filter((num) => "hi");
```

---

```js
// Returns
[1, 2, 3];
```

`filter` performs selection based on the _truthiness_ of the callback's return value. In this case, the return value is always `'hi'`, which is truthy. Therefore `filter` will return a new array containing all of the elements in the original array.
