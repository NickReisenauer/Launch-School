# The Art of Command Line - Joshua Levy

## Basics

- Learn basic Bash. Alternate shells can be nice, but Bash if powerful and always available. Learning other shells like zsh or fish can restrict you in many situations such as existing servers.

- Learn at least one text-based editor. `nano` is a simple option but there is no substitute for `vim`.

- Learn how to find documentation:
  - `man`
  - `apropos` will query the `man` pages based on a keyword you give it and return possible commands
  - `curl.sh/command` will return a brief synopsis of what the command does.
