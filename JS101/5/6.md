One of the most frequently used real-world string operations is that of "string substitution," where we take a hard-coded string and modify it with various parameters from our program.

Given this previously seen family object, print the name, age, and gender of each family member:

```js
let munsters = {
  herman: { age: 32, gender: "male" },
  lily: { age: 30, gender: "female" },
  grandpa: { age: 402, gender: "male" },
  eddie: { age: 10, gender: "male" },
  marilyn: { age: 23, gender: "female" },
};
```

Each output line should follow this pattern:

```txt
(Name) is a (age)-year-old (male or female).
```

## Understanding the Problem

- Input:
  Object with nested objects

- Output:
  String with interpolated values

- Rules / Requirements:
  Given the same nested object as last problem,
  Print out the name, age, and gender for each family member

- Mental Model:
  This might be a good time to use the Object.keys method to get the keys and print the key itself and then the key.age and key.gender

## Examples / Test Cases

```txt
herman is a 32-year-old male.
lily is a 30-year-old female.
etc...
```

## Data Structures

- Nested Objects
  Input
- Object.keys
- forEach
- String
  Output

## Algorithm

Using Object.keys, we can get the key (name) of each nested object.
Once we have the key (name) we can use dot notation to access the other properties available on the object that the key is associated with.
We can then use a forEach loop to loop over and print out the key along with key.age and key.name

## Code

```js
let munsters = {
  herman: { age: 32, gender: "male" },
  lily: { age: 30, gender: "female" },
  grandpa: { age: 402, gender: "male" },
  eddie: { age: 10, gender: "male" },
  marilyn: { age: 23, gender: "female" },
};
Object.keys(munsters).forEach((name) => {
  console.log(
    `${name} is a ${munsters[name].age}-year-old ${munsters[name].gender}.`
  );
});
```
