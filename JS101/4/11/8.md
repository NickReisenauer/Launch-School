# Practice Problem 8

Take a look at the following array.

```js
let flintstones = ["Fred", "Barney", "Wilma", "Betty", "Pebbles", "Bambam"];
```

Write a program that uses this array to create an object where the names are the keys and the values are the positions in the array:

```js
{ Fred: 0, Barney: 1, Wilma: 2, Betty: 3, Pebbles: 4, Bambam: 5 }
```

---

```js
let flintstones = ["Fred", "Barney", "Wilma", "Betty", "Pebbles", "Bambam"];
let result = {};
flintstones.forEach((el, idx) => {
  result[el] = idx;
});
```
