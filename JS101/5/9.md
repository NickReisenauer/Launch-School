Given the following data structure, return a new array with the same structure, but with the subarrays ordered -- alphabetically or numerically as appropriate -- in ascending order.

```js
let arr = [
  ["b", "c", "a"],
  [2, 1, 3],
  ["blue", "black", "green"],
];
```

## Understanding the Problem

- Input:
  Array with sub-arrays

- Output:
  Array with sub-arrays but the sub-arrays are sorted in ascending order

- Rules / Requirements:
  Return new array with same structure as original array
  Each sub-array should be sorted in ascending order

- Mental Model:
  Loop through and call sort() without parameters on each and it will sort them correctly, then push them to a new array

## Examples / Test Cases

```js
let arr = [
  ["a", "b", "c"],
  [1, 2, 3],
  ["black", "blue", "green"],
];
```

## Data Structures

- Nested arrays
  Input
- Sort
- Array
  Output

## Algorithm

Loop over the original array with map and for each inner array, call sort on it without parameters, return new array

## Code

```js
let arr = [
  ["b", "c", "a"],
  [2, 1, 3],
  ["blue", "black", "green"],
];
let sortedArr = arr.map((el) => el.sort());
```

Sorted with sort algorithm in case of double digit numbers:

```js
let arr = [
  ["b", "c", "a"],
  [2, 1, 3],
  ["blue", "black", "green"],
];
let sortedArr = arr.map((el) => {
  if (typeof el[0] === "number") return el.sort((a, b) => a - b);
  return el.sort();
});
```

## Notes

I only used sort without arguments for everything because there are only single digit numbers.
If there were double digit numbers, I would need to implement a sort algorithm because it would sort them by their character codes.
