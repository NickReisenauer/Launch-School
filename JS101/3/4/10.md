## Question 10

Consider these two simple functions:

```js
function foo(param = "no") {
  return "yes";
}

function bar(param = "no") {
  return param === "no" ? "yes" : "no";
}
```

What will the following function invocation return?

```js
bar(foo());
```

---

=> "no"

This is because the value returned from the `foo` function will always be `"yes"` , and `"yes" === "no"` will be `false`.
