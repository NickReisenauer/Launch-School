## Understanding the Problem

- Input:
  String(number), string(number), string(number)

- Output:
  String

- Rules / Requirements:
  Ask the user for the first number.
  Ask the user for the second number.
  Ask the user for an operation to perform.
  Perform the operation on the two numbers.

## Test Cases / Examples

5,3, addition => 8
4,7, multiply => 28
5,1, divide => 5

## Data Structures

- String=>Number
  Input
- If
  Checking input
- String
  Output

## Algorithm

Using readlineSync, get the user's two numbers as well as which operation they'd like to perform, then using if or switch determine their output.
