Perform the same transformation of sorting the subarrays we did in the previous exercise with one difference; sort the elements in descending order.

```js
let arr = [
  ["b", "c", "a"],
  [2, 1, 3],
  ["blue", "black", "green"],
];
```

## Understanding the Problem

- Input:
  Array with nested arrays

- Output:
  Array with nested arrays but they're sorted in descending order

- Rules / Requirements:
  Given an array with arrays inside,
  sort the arrays in descending order
  array contains mixed types of numbers and strings
  Return new array instead of sorting given array in place

- Mental Model:
  Loop over the array with map and check if the array contains strings or numbers and sort in descending order.

## Examples / Test Cases

```js
let arr = [
  ["c", "b", "a"],
  [3, 2, 1],
  ["green", "blue", "black"],
];
```

## Data Structures

- Nested Arrays
  Input
- Map
- Sort
- Nested Arrays
  Output

## Algorithm

Using map, loop over the outer array and check the index [0] to see the type of the first element.
If the first element is a number, return the sub array with sort(a,b) b - a for descending order.
If the first element is a string, return the sub array with sort(a,b) as well.

Return the new sorted array to a new array

## Code

```js
let arr = [
  ["b", "c", "a"],
  [2, 1, 3],
  ["blue", "black", "green"],
];
let sortedArr = arr.map((el) => {
  if (typeof el[0] === "number") return el.sort((a, b) => b - a);
  return el.sort().reverse();
});
```
