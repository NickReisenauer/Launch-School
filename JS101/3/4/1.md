# Practice Problems: Medium 1

## Question 1

Let's do some "ASCII Art": a stone-age form of nerd artwork from back in the days before computers had video screens.

For this practice problem, write a program that creates the following output 10 times, with each line indented 1 space to the right of the line above it:

```js
The Flintstones Rock!
 The Flintstones Rock!
  The Flintstones Rock!
```

---

```js
for (let padding = 1; padding <= 10; padding++) {
  console.log(" ".repeat(padding) + "The Flinstones Rock!");
}
```

```js
const ascii = () => {
  let whitespace = "";
  let string = "The Flintstones Rock!";
  for (let i = 0; i < 10; i += 1) {
    console.log(`${whitespace}${string}`);
    whitespace += " ";
  }
};
ascii();
```
