How would you order the following array of objects based on the year of publication of each book, from the earliest to the latest?

```js
let books = [
  {
    title: "One Hundred Years of Solitude",
    author: "Gabriel Garcia Marquez",
    published: "1967",
  },
  {
    title: "The Great Gatsby",
    author: "F. Scott Fitzgerald",
    published: "1925",
  },
  { title: "War and Peace", author: "Leo Tolstoy", published: "1869" },
  { title: "Ulysses", author: "James Joyce", published: "1922" },
  { title: "The Book of Kells", author: "Multiple Authors", published: "800" },
];
```

## Understanding the Problem

- Input:
  Array of objects

- Output:
  Sorted array of objects

- Rules / Requirements:
  Given array of objects
  Sort the objects based on published date property
  Sort by earliest book to latest book
  Sort original array (mutating operation)

- Mental Model:
  Use the Number() method in addition to sort() to sort by ascending publish date.

## Examples / Test Cases

```js
// Sorted
let books = [
  { title: "The Book of Kells", author: "Multiple Authors", published: "800" },
  { title: "War and Peace", author: "Leo Tolstoy", published: "1869" },
  { title: "Ulysses", author: "James Joyce", published: "1922" },
  {
    title: "The Great Gatsby",
    author: "F. Scott Fitzgerald",
    published: "1925",
  },
  {
    title: "One Hundred Years of Solitude",
    author: "Gabriel Garcia Marquez",
    published: "1967",
  },
];
```

## Data Structure

- Array
- Objects
  Input
- Number
- Sort
- Array
- Objects
  Output

## Algorithm

Sorting the original array,
call sort() and pass in a and b
access the published property on the object with a.published
convert to number with Number(a.published)
Sort by a - b

## Code

```js
let books = [
  { title: "The Book of Kells", author: "Multiple Authors", published: "800" },
  { title: "War and Peace", author: "Leo Tolstoy", published: "1869" },
  { title: "Ulysses", author: "James Joyce", published: "1922" },
  {
    title: "The Great Gatsby",
    author: "F. Scott Fitzgerald",
    published: "1925",
  },
  {
    title: "One Hundred Years of Solitude",
    author: "Gabriel Garcia Marquez",
    published: "1967",
  },
];
books.sort((a, b) => Number(a.published) - Number(b.published));
```
