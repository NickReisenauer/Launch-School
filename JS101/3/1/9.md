# Practice Problems: Easy 1

## Question 9

In the previous problem, our first answer added `'Dino'` to the array like this:

```js
let flintstones = ["Fred", "Barney", "Wilma", "Betty", "Bambam", "Pebbles"];
flintstones.push("Dino");
```

How can we add multiple items to our array? (`'Dino'` and `'Hoppy'`)

---

```js
flintstones.push("Dino", "Hoppy");
```
