# Practice Problem 2

What is the return value of `map` in the following code? Why?

```js
[1, 2, 3].map((num) => {
  num * num;
});
```

---

```js
// Returns
[undefined, undefined, undefined];
```

`map` looks at the return value of the callback function to decide the elements in the returned array. Each element in the original array is replaced by what the callback returns for that element. In this case, there's no explicit return statement in the callback function, which means that the callback returns `undefined` each time.
