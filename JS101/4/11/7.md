# Practice Problem 7

What is the return value of map in the following code? Why?

```js
["ant", "bear"].map((elem) => {
  if (elem.length > 3) {
    return elem;
  }
});
```

---

```js
// Returns
[undefined, "bear"];
```

There are some interesting things to point out here. First, the return value of `map` is an array, which is the collection type that `map` always returns. Second, where did we get that `undefined` value? If we look at the if condition (`elem.length > 3`), we'll notice that it evaluates to `true` when the length of the element is greater than `3`. In this case, the only value with a length greater than `3` is `'bear'`. Thus, for the first element, `'ant'`, the condition evaluates to `false` and `elem` isn't returned.

When a function doesn't explicitly return something, it implicitly returns `undefined`. That's why we see `undefined` as the first element of the returned array.
