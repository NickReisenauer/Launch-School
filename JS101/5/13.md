Given the following data structure, sort the array so that the sub-arrays are ordered based on the sum of the odd numbers that they contain.

```js
let arr = [
  [1, 6, 7],
  [1, 5, 3],
  [1, 8, 3],
];
```

Since `1 + 3 < 1 + 7 < 1 + 5 + 3`, the sorted array should look like this:

```js
[
  [1, 8, 3],
  [1, 6, 7],
  [1, 5, 3],
];
```

## Understanding the Problem

- Input:
  Nested Array

- Output:
  Nested Array sorted

- Rules / Requirements:
  Given the nested array,
  sort the array by ascending order of numbers,
  Inside each array, add the odd numbers to get the "array value"
  sort arrays ascending order based on "array value" from adding odd numbers inside.

- Mental Model:
  Use the sort function in conjunction with the reduce function to figure out the order of the arrays.

## Examples / Test Cases

```js
[
  [1, 8, 3],
  [1, 6, 7],
  [1, 5, 3],
];
```

- Sort

- Sorted Nested Array

## Algorithm

Assuming we're modifying the original array by sorting,
call sort() on the array, then call reduce on both a and b,
inside of reduce, create a guard clause to determine if the number is odd or even, if it's odd add it to the accumulator.
Return the a.reduce statement minus the b.reduce statement so it's directly comparing return values.

## Code

```js
let arr = [
  [1, 6, 7],
  [1, 5, 3],
  [1, 8, 3],
].sort((a, b) => {
  return (
    a.reduce((acc, cur) => {
      if (cur % 2 === 1) return acc + cur;
      else return acc + 0;
    }, 0) -
    b.reduce((acc, cur) => {
      if (cur % 2 === 1) return acc + cur;
      else return acc + 0;
    }, 0)
  );
});
```
