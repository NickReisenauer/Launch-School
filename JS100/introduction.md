# Introduction

Welcome to the Programming and Back-end Prep Course: JavaScript for the program at Launch School. The goal of this prep course is to give you some structure and guidance before starting our real program. You must complete all assignments listed in this course before registering. Otherwise, you may not be able to keep up with the coursework.

## How carefully should I go through this Prep course?

Your goal in our program should not be to "get through it," but to learn the knowledge in it. Getting quickly through it won't help you, but if you can retain and apply the knowledge in the program, you will be able to pass the assessments.

## How is this different than the real course?

The interface here is very similar to the real course. However, in this prep course, there are no discussions and no TAs or instructors. We want you to power through these materials by yourself. Take your time, especially if you've never programmed seriously before (meaning, you've never really sat down and worked through a program for 2 to 4 hours).

## Why do I need to learn JavaScript before starting the first JavaScript course?

If you're new to programming, it's absolutely critical that you take your time to do all the practice problems here. Learning to program in the early stages is a two-step process:

1. Learn programming constructs and grammar and syntax.
2. Learn to build a functioning application with knowledge from above; the "putting it together" stage.

Our courses are focused on #2 - we're like a writer's camp that teaches you how to write an essay or novel. However, to teach higher-level concepts, we need to assume that you know basic grammar and syntax. You must have those skills when you start. Take your time to practice and type out all the practice problems. Train your fingers to type JavaScript code quickly. It's not enough to just say "I understand" - you need to force yourself to go through the act of typing out code, over and over and over.

## How well do I really need to know this?

Work through the materials and books in the assignments, and take as much time as you need to. If you're very new to programming, the more practice you have with a programming language, the better. It's vital to set strong foundations early. There's no use in learning higher-level frameworks or libraries if you don't have strong basic programming knowledge. The time invested in learning the basics now will pay off a hundred times over in the future.
