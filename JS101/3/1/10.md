## Question 9

Return a new version of this sentence that ends just before the word `house`. Don't worry about spaces or punctuation: remove everything starting from the beginning of `house` to the end of the sentence.

```js
let advice =
  "Few things in life are as important as house training your pet dinosaur.";

// Expected return value:
// => 'Few things in life are as important as '
```

---

```js
advice.slice(0, advice.indexOf("house"));
```
