# Practice Problem 6

How does `Array.prototype.fill` work? Is it destructive? How can we find out?

```js
let arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
arr.fill(1, 1, 5);
```

---

```js
// Returns
[1, 1, 1, 1, 1];
```

`fill` takes a value and two indices and replaces the indices in between those two given indices with the given value. We can also verify that it's a destructive method.
