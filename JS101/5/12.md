Given the following data structure, use a combination of methods, including `filter`, to return a new array identical in structure to the original, but containing only the numbers that are multiples of 3.

```js
let arr = [[2], [3, 5, 7], [9], [11, 15, 18]];
```

# PEDAC

## Understanding the Problem

- Input:
  Array with sub arrays

- Output:
  Array with sub arrays but only numbers that are multiples of 3

- Rules / Requirements:
  Use `filter` with other methods to return new array of elements that are multiples of 3.
  Don't modify original array
  Can I use map to return the actual array and filter inside?

- Mental Model:
  Use map and inside map use filter to create an array of elements that are multiples of 3

## Examples / Test Cases

```js
let arr = [[], [3], [9], [15, 18]];
```

## Data Structures

- Nested Array
  Input
- Map
- Filter
- Remainder operator %
- Nested Array
  Output

## Algorithm

Use map to loop over the array,
for each sub array, filter through it's elements and determine which of them are multiples of 3, use filter to return an array containing the elements that are multiples of 3,
use map to return the final array with the same structure.

## Code

```js
let arr = [[2], [3, 5, 7], [9], [11, 15, 18]];
let sortedArr = arr.map((el) => el.filter((num) => num % 3 === 0));
```
